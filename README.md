# cfc_ulx_commands
Repo for CFC's custom ULX commands (that aren't separate)


## Curse Effect Config:
A serverside config for curse effects can be made by creating `cfc_ulx_commands/curse/sv_config.json` in the server's `data/` folder.
Default/example settings can be found [here](/lua/cfc_ulx_commands/curse/sv_config_default.json).
Any live edits made to the config will apply after a changelevel (e.g. using the `ulx map` command).
